## 1. Architecture Overview
The application is a **Flutter-based mobile/web app** designed for collaborative task management ("EasyTaskFlow"). It follows a standard Layered Architecture:

*   **Frontend (UI):** Located in `lib/screens/`. Key flows include Authentication, Project Management (List, Detail, Calendar), Task Management, and In-App Messaging.
*   **State Management:** `flutter_riverpod` is included in `pubspec.yaml`, though direct usage in screens seems minimal (FutureBuilders/Streams are used directly in some places).
*   **Backend (BaaS):** **Firebase** is the primary backend.
    *   **Auth:** Firebase Auth (Email/Password + Google Sign-In).
    *   **Database:** Cloud Firestore (`users`, `projects`, `tasks`, `messages` collections).
    *   **Storage:** Firebase Storage (for task file attachments).
*   **Integrations:**
    *   **Google Calendar:** Implemented via `googleapis` and `google_sign_in`.
    *   **Dynamic Links:** Firebase Dynamic Links (likely for project invitations).

## 2. Feature Status
Based on code analysis of `lib/screens/` and `lib/services/`:

| Feature Area | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | ✅ **Complete** | Login, Signup, AuthWrapper, Google Sign-In fully implemented. |
| **Project CRUD** | ✅ **Complete** | Create, Read (List/Detail), Update (Add Member), Delete implemented. |
| **Task Management** | ✅ **Complete** | Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks within projects. |
| **Messaging** | ✅ **Complete** | Real-time chat per project (`messages` sub-collection). |
| **File Attachments** | ⚠️ **Partial** | `uploadFile` exists in service, but UI integration in `TaskDetail` needs verification. |
| **Calendar Sync** | ⚠️ **Partial** | `GoogleApiService` exists, but UI integration is basic. |
| **Settings** | ✅ **Complete** | Profile update and Logout functioning. |

## 3. Gap Analysis
*   **Missing Error Handling:** Many service calls (e.g., `createProject`) lack try-catch blocks in the UI, which could lead to silent failures.
*   **Duplicate Dependencies:** (FIXED) `url_launcher` was duplicated in `pubspec.yaml` causing build failures. This has been resolved in the latest commit.
*   **Testing:** `test/` folder structure exists but test coverage appears minimal/non-existent for new features.
*   **Hardcoded Values:** Some strings and configurations might be hardcoded; no localization setup (`l10n.yaml`) observed yet.

## 4. Inferred Goal
**EasyTaskFlow** is a collaborative project management tool intended for small teams. It allows users to create projects, invite members (likely via email/link), create tasks with deadlines and file attachments, and communicate in real-time via a project-specific chat. It aims to integrate closely with Google ecosystems (Calendar, Sign-In).
