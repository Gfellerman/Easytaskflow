# EasyTaskFlow: Project Vision and Plan

## 1. Core Philosophy

The primary goal of EasyTaskFlow is to provide a simple, intuitive, and performant project management tool. It is designed to be an antidote to the overly complex and feature-bloated tools on the market. Simplicity is our core principle.

Future development will be guided by user feedback, with a strict focus on adding value without compromising the app's ease of use.

## 2. Business Model: Freemium

EasyTaskFlow will operate on a freemium model to provide a low barrier to entry for new users while offering powerful features for paid subscribers.

*   **Free Version:**
    *   Limited to **3 users** per project.
    *   Limited to **10 main tasks** per project.
    *   Limited to **10 subtasks** per main task.
    *   Limited document storage (size and number TBD).
    *   Includes a basic tier of AI-powered assistance.

*   **Paid Version:**
    *   Unlimited users, tasks, and subtasks.
    *   Significantly larger document storage.
    *   Access to the most advanced AI features and support.
    *   Pricing will be determined based on the operational costs of backend services (cloud storage, LLM usage).
